2009-07-16 - Field "Hours worked" added to helpdesk item edit form. Can be used to log spent time when creating new item  
2009-07-20 - permissions related updates
2009-07-22 - notification system redesigned to be more flexible and to minimize emails sent:
              - only one email is sent when tasklog modified status/calltype/etc.
              - unified email format for tasklogs and ticket modifications emails
              - if ticket is created and remain Unassigned email is sent
                to an address defined in helpdesk configuration in case of email notification required
              - added configuration radioboxes to choose whether watchers / requestor 
                are notified about all logs or only about status changes (incl. requestor change & calltype change)
              - emails are not sent to current user      
           - if ticket is created by an user from non-helpdesk company, the user is filled-in as requestor
           - localization applied on notification texts ( I hope everywhere ) 
2009-07-24 - when adding watchers notifications were not send always correctly. Unified with another notification emails.
